Work related to learning to steer using deep learning working with [Udacity drive
data](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car/tree/master/datasets/CH2).
Transformation from rosbag to csv data done using scripts created by [Ross Wightman](https://github.com/rwightman/udacity-driving-reader)

Objective is to implement Nvidia original PilotNet and top performing algorithms
presented in the [Udacity
challenge](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car/tree/master/steering-models/community-models)
and apply to autonomous mobile robots at a smaller scale.
