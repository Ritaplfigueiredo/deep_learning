Notes:
---
2/2/2018 CNN-LSTM pipeline working, but only learning single value...need to
debug.

1/31/2018 RMSE of 0.2044 with Alexnet feature layers + fc -> regression finetuning.

1/28/2018 Got results with RMSE of 0.21, some papers indicating PilotNet should
get closer to 0.16. 

1/28/2018 Moving pilotnet related work to PyTorch.
